    <p> Estimation:<br>
        To estimate the amount of time it would take to complete this project, we used the LOC (lines of code)<br> 
        method to determine the necessary time. To determine the number of lines of code to be added, we first<br> 
        looked at how many lines were written for the original project, which was 628. Using this number, we<br> 
        estimated that we would need another 150 lines of code to complete the project. From here, we determined<br> 
        that the personâ€”hours per line of code would be .25 hours, including learning JavaScript and actually<br> 
        writing the code. Using these two numbers, we determined that we would need 37.5 hours to<br> 
        complete the project. </p>

    <p>Review of our Estimation:<br>
        Upon completion of the project, it took us roughly 28 hours to complete our project. This is because we<br>
        overestimated how long it would take us to understand the existing code and learn JavaScript. We were also<br> 
        met with fewer issues than we had anticipated with the integration of our additions and the original code<br></p>
