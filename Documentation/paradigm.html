                <li>Classes: Gameboard, Ship, Player, Game</li>
                <li>A game object is initially created. At the beginning of the game, inside the Game class, 2 Player objects are created and
                    the attibtutes are initiallized based off of the users inputs. (If playing with an AI, only 1 Player object is created). Each Player
                    object contains a Gameboard object (used to determine the state of each players attack) and an array of Ship objects (used to place
                    a players ship). The Gameboard class uses the array of Ship objects to determine if an attack has hit or missed the other players ship.

            <ul>
                <li>At the beginning of the game, the programs collects data from the user by asking the following: "Player1 what is your name?", "Play against an AI",
                    (if playing with an AI) "What difficulty?", (If not playing with an AI) "Player2, what is your name?". With this data, the program is able to
                    create a game with either 2 players or 1 player and an AI at a set difficulty. The programs control structure is based off the data.
